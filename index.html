  <div class="container">
    <p>We believe in a local circular economy — not as a trend, but as a necessity. The materials we use every day have already gone through immense journeys: shaped, refined, transported, consumed. It took time, energy, and resources to create them. Discarding them without a second thought is not only wasteful — it’s a missed opportunity.</p>

    <p>What if the things around us had a second life? A chair, a coat, a wooden frame. These objects carry stories, textures, and materials that still have value. Slowing down, rethinking what we throw away, and placing more care into the objects we choose to keep — that’s where we begin.</p>

    <p>The City Project is creating a new system in Vienna — one built around reuse, collaboration, and meaning. We collect discarded materials from the city — wood, leather, textiles, metal, objects — and we work with artists, students, and small brands to transform them into thoughtful, useful pieces.</p>

    <p>The process is simple and evolving:<br>
    We gather what the city no longer wants.<br>
    We clean, sort, and catalogue.<br>
    We rethink design from the material up — not forcing ideas, but letting the materials guide us.<br>
    And we collaborate with local creators to produce small, smart, beautiful collections with purpose.</p>

    <p>This isn’t about mass production. It’s about building a model that works locally, with resources already here, and using design as a tool to reconnect people with their environment.</p>

    <div class="cta">
      <p>Are you a student, an artist, a shop owner, or a small brand looking to bring circularity into your work or life?</p>
      <p>Do you want to experiment with materials that already exist, to create something meaningful, sustainable — and entirely your own?</p>
      <a href="#contact">Let’s explore how we can work together</a>
    </div>

    <p>Why Vienna?<br>
    Because the city is already producing valuable materials every day — they’re just being overlooked. Because a circular system must start somewhere. And because Vienna is full of talent, ideas, and potential waiting to be connected.</p>

    <p>We don’t need another green label. We need a method. A system that works on a small scale, with high creativity, and real social and environmental value. That’s what we’re building.</p>
