    <p>Our scope is rooted in action — and it evolves with the people we work with. From material sourcing to design execution, we’re involved in every step:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Collecting usable discarded materials across Vienna — from furniture, garments, shops, and homes.</li>
      <li>Processing and organizing materials by type, condition, and potential.</li>
      <li>Redefining what “waste” means — turning each object into the start of something new.</li>
      <li>Planning design processes with creators who want to work differently — slower, smarter, and more sustainably.</li>
      <li>Collaborating with students, artists, designers, and small brands on custom product lines.</li>
      <li>Producing in small, limited runs to keep waste minimal and value high.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our methodology is built to be flexible, efficient, and always in progress. We adapt based on the material at hand, the needs of our partners, and the ideas that emerge through collaboration.</p>

    <p>We don't follow rigid steps — instead, we treat this as a living system. Some parts are currently being studied in partnership with universities to measure impact and improve our processes. We're also developing a material library: a catalog of sorted, ready-to-use resources from Vienna’s waste stream.</p>

    <p>Everything we collect is accounted for. What we can’t use immediately is stored, studied, and made available to others. Almost nothing is thrown away. The material library is not just a storage system — it’s an open invitation.</p>

    <p>Would you like to visit? You might find the beginning of your next project sitting right there — waiting for its second life.</p>
